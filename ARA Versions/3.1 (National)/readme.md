It has many more modifications than all previous cars, both in terms of weight, portability, sensor equipment, and larger dimensions than all previous models, which goes against our philosophy of a small robot. However, we realized that this longer and more robustly stable design gives us many more capabilities when it comes to modifying it, as it saves us a lot of physical work after printing. An example of this is the cover, which we no longer have to adapt in comparison to previous robots. This one has a 40% wider turning angle than the previous robot, which already had a greater angle than the 1.1, so it will help us a lot when it comes to leaving parking spaces and parking, and in terms of traction, we adapted and designed a differential for the national competition to prevent skidding on curves.
