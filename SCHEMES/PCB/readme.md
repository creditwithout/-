A Gerber file is a standard 2D file format that describes each layer of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for manufacturing, essentially acting as a detailed blueprint for the physical board. It includes information on copper layers, solder mask, silkscreen, and drill holes, specifying the shape, size, and precise X-Y coordinates of every feature on the board. PCB design software generates these files, which are then used by manufacturers to create the physical PCB through processes like etching and drilling.
