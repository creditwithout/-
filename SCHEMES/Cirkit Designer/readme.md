Circuit Designer is a program to build and simulate electronic circuits on your computer. It lets you place resistors, power sources, LEDs, and more like a digital breadboard. You can see how current flows and measure voltages without burning anything. Itâ€™s handy for learning, testing ideas, and avoiding mistakes before soldering. Basically, itâ€™s your electrical lab on a screen.

We also decided to use this platform because it allows other users to view the circuits in real time, making it a much more interactive and organized experience. It should be noted that everything is public.
