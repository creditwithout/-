First was the normal design that you can see in the previous folders, and then we proceeded with the schematic, which is also detailed in the previous folders.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Regarding the gyroscope that is in the circuit on GitHub, we no longer use that one; we now use the `BNO086`. However, it is from the original `SparkFun chip`, so we did not have time to modify it in the circuits, but all the original photos will show it. Nevertheless, it has the same connections as the previous one and better functionality, but it is basically the same, only with better electronics. You can find out more about the gyroscope [Here](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-vr-imu-breakout-bno086-qwiic.html), other wise we'll explain briefly hereüòÅ.
