- Fritzing is an open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool designed for rapid prototyping and documentation of electronic systems.
- It provides a unified workflow transitioning from breadboard-level physical wiring to schematic representation and finally to PCB fabrication layouts.
- The platform includes three fully synchronized environments: Breadboard View, Schematic View, and PCB View.
- Breadboard View emulates physical prototyping with accurate pin mapping and component footprints for real-world consistency.
- Schematic View abstracts designs into formal electrical diagrams suitable for signal flow and circuit analysis.
- PCB View supports copper trace routing, via placement, ground plane generation, and Gerber file export for manufacturing.
- A netlist synchronization engine ensures real-time connectivity consistency across all views.

## USAGE
Our use of Fritzing was extremely important, as it provided us with a 2D schematic of our entire circuit, allowing us to fix problems much more easily. It also recently served as a very important guide in the manufacturing and subsequent printing of our PCB, as the PCB View option allowed us to make many modifications in order to design the PCB much better.
