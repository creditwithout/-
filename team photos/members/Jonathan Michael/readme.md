He was born in Panama City on February 10. From a very young age, he has been passionate about sports, especially soccer, because watching soccer makes him sleepy. Since childhood, he has proven to be capable and intelligent, demonstrating strong logical and practical reasoning skills that his brother lacks, as he has a more abstract and creative vision. However, some of his hobbies include chess, playing video games such as Fortnite and Roblox, and since 2019, he has been an active member of the BMIESJ band, playing the clarinet (and continues to do so today).

He also has an incredible sense of music. He is the most rhythmic member of the team, the one who listens to a song and tells you what time signature it is and everything. This seems logical, since he plays the electric bass with great skill, having taught himself.

And he is no slouch in robotics either, as in 2022 he reached the national stage in the future innovators category and from there went on to represent the country at WRO 2022, which was held in Dortmund, Germany. And this year, 2025, is his first year participating in a track category (future engineers), as until ninth grade he was in future junior innovators.
