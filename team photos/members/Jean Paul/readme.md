Hello, I am Jean Paul Sosa Cruz. I am currently 18 years old at the time of the competition. (August 18, 2007). I was born in Mexico, specifically in Tampio, Tamaulipas. Since I was a child, I have always been interested in technology, the arts, sports, and especially the world of robotics, which is why I competed in KODU competitions for regionals in Panama since I was a child. In the first one I participated in, I became champion in 2017. Since 2018, I have been an active member of my school's music band (BMIESJ), where I played the alto saxophone for six years and occasionally the soprano saxophone. In 2024, I will play the tenor saxophone.

I am someone who cannot live without music, as it is a profession I would like to pursue. I taught myself to play the guitar, bass, and piano (the latter I use for music theory) without anyone's help, and I am very passionate about playing and listening to music, bands such as The Beatles, Radiohead, Seru Giran, and classical music.

In ninth grade, I entered robotics for the first time without any real experience in this type of robot competition. All I knew was software, so that year I participated for the first time in the Junior Future Innovators category, advancing to the national phase and winning that year, 2022, and representing the country at WRO Germany 2022.

And in 12th grade, I participated for the second time in the Future Engineers category, where I won the national competition and represented the country in Turkey 2024.
