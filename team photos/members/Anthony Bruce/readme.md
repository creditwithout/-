He was born in Panama on December 29, 2007. I haven't known him since he was that young, but it's well known that since elementary school he has been a nerd and an intelligent, exemplary student, as he is someone who is extremely interested in science.

He is fascinated above all by biology and dinosaurs, and no one can beat him in those subjects. He has also been honored twice in a row in physics and mathematics at the National Physics Olympiad (ONF), so he is someone who is always looking to improve and learn more. In biology, she has participated twice in the SENACYT science fair in the environmental sciences category, placing third both years, which is quite an accomplishment and demonstrates her determination.

She is also a huge fan of ranchera music and Jurassic Park and currently plays the trumpet in the BMIESJ.

On the team, he is a programmer in C++ and Python, and he is also responsible, together with the team, for developing the logic of the robot in competitions.
