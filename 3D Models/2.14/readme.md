## Main chassisðŸš„
Our chassis is fully printed with CREALITY PETG-CR filament material, as we want our chassis to be resistant and not wear out so quickly when implementing gear mechanisms.

## Mobility management

We use a pIÃ±on and shaft that connects to a Pololu motor that consumes 12 volts, and we control it through a motor driver.
