# 3.1 MODELS
In this section, we will explain each 3D part of our ARA 3.1 robot, which is the robot that will compete in the national WRO competition in Panama.

## Mount Tape

Here you can find each part shown in the GIF, from the assembly of the robot's cover.

- [Main Upper mount](https://github.com/creditwithout/-/blob/main/3D%20Models/3.1%20(National)/ARAROBOT%20-%20Main%20tape%203.1.stl) : The main cover of the robot (everything is printed in Bambolabs ```PETG-CF``` filament, see below for more information) is mounted using M3 screws, and the entire top cover is assembled without screws for easier handling of the robot. It has a ```double circular tower system ``` so that it fits into each hole in the top plates. The bottom of the main plate has a horizontal support for the ``` LIPPO 12V battery```, so that it cannot rub against any components. It has a fairly minimalist design, with aggressive tips that save filament and lighten the weight of the robot.

- [Battery mount tape](https://github.com/creditwithout/-/blob/main/3D%20Models/3.1%20(National)/ARAROBOT%20-%20TAPA%20BATERIA%20(1).stl) : This is the top box that prevents the ```12V battery (LIPPO)``` from coming out, and it has holes that fit and lock into the main base to avoid using screws.
  
- [PCB Support](https://github.com/creditwithout/-/blob/main/3D%20Models/3.1%20(National)/ARAROBOT%20-%20PCB%20Mount%20tape.stl) : This is the base that supports our entire circuit and holds our printed circuit board (PCB) and some sensors and regulators.

## Steering

We greatly improved the steering system for this national competition compared to previous regional competitions, since now that we do the first round in ```30 seconds```, we needed a greater angle of gro in case the ultrasonic sensor gave a delayed measurement, and thus avoid a collision. Therefore, we had to redesign the arms and servo fittings and the front arm amplitude so that the turning arc could have a much greater turning angle. This ```steering``` system no longer follows the guidelines of an ```Ackerman system```.

## Traction

Most of the parts that make up the traction system are bolted together to provide greater stability and security in how each part is attached inside our robot.

One of the many innovations we had was to add a ```differential``` to our robot, in order to eliminate skidding on curves and help achieve a wider turning angle. We designed this differential based on a crown gear set, which we will explain below with graphics, interactive illustrations, and some of the science behind it.

- On the x-axis ‚Üí time ```(ùë°)``` during a turning maneuver
- On the y-axis ‚Üí angular velocity ```(ùúî)``` of each component in rad/s.

#### Three curves are plotted:
- (left wheel) ‚Üí blue line: speed of the left wheel.
- (right wheel) ‚Üí orange line: speed of the right wheel.
- (driveshaft) ‚Üí dotted line: speed of the input shaft.
