# 3.1 MODELS
In this section, we will explain each 3D part of our ARA 3.1 robot, which is the robot that will compete in the national WRO competition in Panama.

Here you can find each part shown in the GIF, from the assembly of the robot's cover.

- [Main Upper mount](https://github.com/creditwithout/-/blob/main/3D%20Models/3.1%20(National)/ARAROBOT%20-%20Main%20tape%203.1.stl) : The main cover of the robot (everything is printed in Bambolabs ```PETG-CF``` filament, see below for more information) is mounted using M3 screws, and the entire top cover is assembled without screws for easier handling of the robot. It has a ```double circular tower system ``` so that it fits into each hole in the top plates. The bottom of the main plate has a horizontal support for the ``` LIPPO 12V battery```, so that it cannot rub against any components. It has a fairly minimalist design, with aggressive tips that save filament and lighten the weight of the robot.

- [Battery mount tape](https://github.com/creditwithout/-/blob/main/3D%20Models/3.1%20(National)/ARAROBOT%20-%20TAPA%20BATERIA%20(1).stl) : This is the top box that prevents the ```12V battery (LIPPO)``` from coming out, and it has holes that fit and lock into the main base to avoid using screws.
  
- [PCB Support](https://github.com/creditwithout/-/blob/main/3D%20Models/3.1%20(National)/ARAROBOT%20-%20PCB%20Mount%20tape.stl) : This is the base that supports our entire circuit and holds our printed circuit board (PCB) and some sensors and regulators.
